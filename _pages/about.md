My name is Ionu»õ and I am a Ph.D. student working in optimization for Deep Neural Networks at the Institute of Science and Technology 
Austria (ISTA) under the supervision of [Dan Alistarh](https://people.csail.mit.edu/alistarh/).

My main interest is improving the optimization algorithms for Deep Learning, especially Large Language Models (LLMs). I am especially 
focused on reducing the memory usage of optimizer states by leveraging techniques like sparsity and low-rank compression.

Before starting my PhD in October 2021 at ISTA, I worked as a Research Scientist at Amazon. Prior to that, I was an intern at the 
University of Maryland in College Park, USA and worked under the supervision of [Tudor Dumitras](https://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~tudor/).
